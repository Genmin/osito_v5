# Osito Protocol Testing Summary

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the testing suite implemented for the Osito Protocol. The testing approach covers multiple layers of verification to ensure protocol safety and correctness.

## Testing Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
Located in `test/unit/`

- **OsitoToken.t.sol**: Tests basic ERC20 functionality and burn mechanism
  - Constructor initialization
  - Burn functionality and supply reduction
  - Transfer and approval mechanisms
  - Fuzz testing for burn and transfer operations

- **PMinLib.t.sol**: Critical tests for pMin calculation
  - Zero supply edge cases
  - All tokens in pool scenario
  - Partial token distribution
  - Fee impact on pMin
  - Monotonic increase with burns and fee accumulation
  - Comprehensive fuzz testing of formula

- **OsitoPair.t.sol**: Tests AMM functionality
  - Initialization and state verification
  - Swap mechanics with fee calculation
  - LP token restrictions
  - pMin oracle functionality
  - Fee decay mechanism

### 2. Integration Tests
Located in `test/integration/`

- **FullProtocolFlow.t.sol**: End-to-end protocol lifecycle
  - Token launch
  - Trading with high initial fees
  - Lending deployment
  - Borrowing against collateral
  - Fee collection and token burns
  - Interest accrual
  - Debt repayment

### 3. Fuzz Tests
Located in `test/fuzz/`

- **CriticalFuzz.t.sol**: Property-based testing
  - Token launch parameter fuzzing
  - Swap safety with random amounts
  - Lending operation fuzzing
  - Fee collection randomization
  - Ensures invariants hold under extreme conditions

### 4. Invariant Tests
Located in `test/invariant/`

- **OsitoInvariants.t.sol**: Protocol-wide invariants
  - pMin monotonically increases
  - k (constant product) never decreases
  - Total supply never increases
  - LP token restrictions maintained
  - All loans safe at pMin valuation
  - Fee decay correctness
  - Protocol solvency

### 5. Mutation Tests
Located in `test/mutation/`

- **MutationTests.t.sol**: Tests that should fail if core logic mutates
  - pMin formula exactness
  - Fee decay linearity
  - Constant product maintenance
  - Liquidation safety calculations
  - Interest accrual precision

### 6. Formal Verification
Located in `test/formal/`

- **OsitoSpecs.spec**: Certora specifications
  - Mathematical proofs of pMin monotonicity
  - Supply reduction verification
  - Liquidation safety guarantees
  - No token creation possible
  - LP token restriction enforcement

## Key Protocol Properties Verified

### 1. Safety Properties
- ✅ **No Bad Debt**: All loans are 100% safe at pMin valuation
- ✅ **Liquidation Safety**: Liquidations always profitable at min(spot, pMin)
- ✅ **Solvency**: Total borrows never exceed total assets

### 2. Economic Properties
- ✅ **pMin Monotonic**: pMin only increases, never decreases
- ✅ **Supply Deflationary**: Token supply only decreases via burns
- ✅ **k Growth**: Constant product grows with fees

### 3. Access Control
- ✅ **LP Restrictions**: LP tokens only held by feeRouter or pair
- ✅ **No Admin Keys**: All functions permissionless
- ✅ **Immutable Contracts**: No upgradability risks

## Test Execution

Run all tests with:
```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

Individual test categories:
```bash
# Unit tests
forge test --match-path test/unit/*.t.sol -vvv

# Fuzz tests (10k runs)
forge test --match-path test/fuzz/*.t.sol --fuzz-runs 10000

# Invariant tests
forge test --match-path test/invariant/*.t.sol --invariant-runs 1000

# Integration tests
forge test --match-path test/integration/*.t.sol -vvv

# Mutation tests
forge test --match-path test/mutation/*.t.sol -vvv
```

## Coverage Goals
- Line Coverage: >95%
- Branch Coverage: >90%
- Function Coverage: 100%

## Security Analysis Tools
- **Slither**: Static analysis for common vulnerabilities
- **Mythril**: Symbolic execution for deep analysis
- **Certora**: Formal verification of mathematical properties

## Continuous Testing
The test suite is designed to run in CI/CD pipelines with different profiles:
- `default`: Standard testing (10k fuzz runs)
- `ci`: Extended testing (50k fuzz runs)
- `mutation`: Exhaustive testing (100k fuzz runs)

## Critical Findings
All tests pass with no critical issues found. The protocol maintains its key invariants under all tested conditions.
