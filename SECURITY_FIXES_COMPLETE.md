# Security Fixes Complete - Osito V5

## All Critical Vulnerabilities Patched ✅

Following the Osito philosophy: **"Subtract until the flaw has nowhere left to hide"**

### Changes Made (7 lines total)

#### 1. Re-entrancy Protection (3 lines)
- `LenderVault.sol:12` - Added ReentrancyGuard inheritance
- `LenderVault.sol:67` - Added nonReentrant to borrow()
- `LenderVault.sol:74` - Added nonReentrant to repay()

#### 2. Front-running Prevention (2 lines)
- `CollateralVault.sol:189` - Moved getReserves() before transfer
- `CollateralVault.sol:198` - Transfer happens after snapshot

#### 3. OTM Flag Management (1 line)
- `CollateralVault.sol:135` - Clear OTM on partial repay if healthy

#### 4. Code Simplification (-1 line)
- `OsitoToken.sol` - Removed unused mintLocked variable

### What We Did NOT Add
✅ No TWAP oracles - continuous OTM is sufficient
✅ No custom guards - using battle-tested Solady
✅ No fee-on-transfer handling - WBERA only
✅ No keeper accrual - lazy pattern works
